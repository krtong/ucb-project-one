# current concept: generalized social media map app
- Reddit and Twitter focus almost entirely on discussions around news articles with strangers.  Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram are almost entirely around images with friends. Build a web app prototype that builds social interactions around shared geography.
- Include a map that allows people to see posts made by users. 
- Create signup, login, and create-post form.
- Create a list of posts sorted primarily by distance from user.

# Dpendencies needed for project:
- Firebase firestore (database)
- Firebase auth (user tracking and password encryption)
- Leafletjs for maps
- Quill for Rich text editing of posts.
- Bootstrap for layout
- Jquery for state changes and event handling (npm / nodejs is not allowed)
